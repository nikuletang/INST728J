 <h2>About Niku</h2>
 <p>My name is Niku Letang. I was born on July 8, 1990 on the Caribbean island of Dominica. When I was 14 years old, I moved to the United States with my mother. I have a bacherlor's degree in Political Science and a Master's degree in Public Administration. Although my educational background is not in computer science or programming, 
I am interested in website and database development. I taught myself how to create websites at a young age as a hobby in an effort to express myself. However, I do not have advanced programming knowledge and skills. I hope to enhance the skills I do have by taking this course and others in UMD's INFO college. I currently work as an Applications Coordinator in the 
Education Abroad office at UMD. My responsibilities including updating the website, managing a student database, facilitating data reporting on study aborad enrollment, and overseeing
the office's social media initiatives.

I enjoy relaxing at home while reading or watching my favorite TV shows, documentaries or YouTube channels. I also enjoy cooking, particularly creating vegan versions of popular non-plant based meals. I also do interior decorating for fun. When I am not home, you can find me 
traveling, shopping for home decor, socializing with friends, or enjoing nature.</p>
